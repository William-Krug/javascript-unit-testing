# JavaScript Unit Testing

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This repo was created to practice unit testing and Test Driven Development (TDD) practices. `.test.js` files were written first to capture normal use cases and then edge cases of bad or missing inputs. Implementation code was then written to handle all test cases.

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Fork and clone the repo to the directory of your choice
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
3. Run `npm test` in your terminal to see the test results
4. Run `node FindNextTPHNumber/findNextTPHNumber.js` to run the implementation code

## Usage

1. The `findNextTPHNumber()` function calculates the next: Triangular Number === Pentagonal Number === Hexagonal Number based on the starting input values.
2. Each Number (Triangular, Pentagonal, Hexagonal) have their own functions that are called to calculate their respective Numbers.
3. When `node FindNextTPHNumber/findNextTPHNumber.js` is run, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Numbers are found along with their starting values to reach the Number from each calculation.
4. All functions have corresponding unit tests.

## Built With

- JavaScript
- Node
